# Steam‑like Template (Node.js + Express)

Dark, Steam‑inspired UI without Valve trademarks/logos. Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no external CDNs.

## Run
```bash
npm i
npm run dev   # or: npm start
# open http://localhost:4021
```

## Notes
- Colors and layout are "Steam‑like" but *not* 1:1 copied assets.
- Replace placeholder images and text as you wish (see `public/assets/`).
